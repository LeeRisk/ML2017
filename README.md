# ML2017

This repository contains 4 homeworks from the Machine Learning course taught by
Hung-Yi Lee (李弘毅) at the National Taiwan University, 2017 Spring.

http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~tlkagk/courses_ML17.html

Under each HW directory, you find:

1. the instruction of the homework in .pptx
2. files to use for the homework
3. my attemps in .R
4. my outputted answers

It was asked to be in Python/C/C++, but... whatever. :P
